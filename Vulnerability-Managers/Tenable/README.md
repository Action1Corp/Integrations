# Action1 -- Tenable Integration Quickstart Guide

## Overview

The **Action1--Tenable Integration** automates the correlation of
vulnerability data between Tenable Vulnerability Management and Action1,
allowing IT and security teams to:

-   Correlate detected vulnerabilities from Tenable
-   Match vulnerabilities to Action1-managed endpoints
-   Detect "unknown" or "missing" assets from each platform
-   Generate reports for compliance and tracking

This guide explains what the integration does, how to set up API
credentials for both Action1 and Tenable, and how to run the PowerShell
script.
It is recommended to run the script on the same frequency as Tenable
vulnerability scans.

## What the Integration Does

The PowerShell integration script:

-   Connects to Tenable.io to pull vulnerability data
-   Connects to Action1 Cloud Console to pull vulnerability data
-   Compares vulnerability data to identify:
    -   Patchable vulnerabilities
    -   Non-patchable vulnerabilities
    -   CVEs not recognized by Action1
    -   Missing assets from Action1
    -   Missing assets from Tenable
-   **Optional:** Emails generated reports

## Prerequisites

Before running the integration:

-   PowerShell **5.1 or later** (Windows 10/11, Server 2016+)
-   Network access to:
    -   `https://cloud.tenable.com`
    -   `https://app.action1.com`
-   API credentials for **both** platforms

## Getting Action1 API Credentials

1.  Log in to Action1: https://app.action1.com
2.  Go to **Users & API Credentials**
3.  Click **New API Credentials**
4.  Save:
    -   Client ID
    -   Client Secret
    -   Organization ID

Use these in the script:

    $Action1ApiKey = "<your_client_id>"
    $Action1ApiSecret = "<your_client_secret>"
    $Action1OrgId = "<your_organization_id>"

## Getting Tenable API Keys

1.  Log in to: https://cloud.tenable.com
2.  Go to **My Profile → API Keys**
3.  Generate API keys
4.  Save:
    -   Access Key
    -   Secret Key

Use in script:

    $TenableAccessKey = "<your_access_key>"
    $TenableSecretKey = "<your_secret_key>"

## Running the Integration Script

Update the parameters before running the script.
